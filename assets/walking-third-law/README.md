# How we walk: the third law (হাঁটা ও নিউটনের তৃতীয় সূত্র)

**Where it goes in the book:** Book page 86, topic 3.8 (example): how we walk. Next to চিত্র ৩.১২ (a person's foot pushing the ground back, the ground pushing the person forward, labelled F and −F).

Interactive 3D figure for the Pathshala book. How we walk, the example that explains Newton's third law: a student
stands on a path, seen from the side. One big numbered button (its badge rings the pushing foot) takes the first
push-off of a walk, slowed down 4 times, and holds at the telling moment: in everyday words, "পা মাটিকে ঠেলছে" (an
arrow on the ground) and "মাটি মানুষটিকে ঠেলছে" (an arrow at the shoe), the two equally long. The row of words is the
page's three grounds: firm ground (100 N each way, the student moves off), loose sand (the sand gives way, 50 N) and a
floor made slippery with soapy water or oil (the foot slides back, only 20 N, the student hardly moves). One result
line, one short rule per idea, and the book's own sentence last, once all three grounds are found, when the two
pushes also get the book's names F and −F. Numbers are for an example 50 kg student; the book gives none. A test of
5 questions follows, in the same plain words.

To listen to it or control it from the book page, use the helper shipped in the zip:

```html
<script type="module">
  import { connectAsset } from './walking-third-law/shared/lib/host.js';
  const figure = connectAsset(document.querySelector('iframe'));
  await figure.ready;
  figure.on('change', (state) => console.log(state));
</script>
